            <h2>About Blackjack</h2>
            <p>Black Jack is a card game between a player and a dealer. The player competes against the dealer and not against other players. It is played with one or more decks of 52 cards. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer in one of the following ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Get 21 points on the player's first two cards (called a "blackjack" or "natural"), without a dealer blackjack;</li>
                <li>Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21; or</li>
                <li>Let the dealer draw additional cards until their hand exceeds 21.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <p>Blackjack is played with a standard 52-card deck and is a very simple game that requires a certain amount of skill based on a certain amount of luck. The luck part has to do with the cards you are dealt and the skill has to do with learning some basic strategiesâ€”mainly knowing when to hit, stand, split or double-down. Most players start learning by referring to a basic strategy chart. The strategy chart shows you how to play your first two cards based on the dealers up card. Referring back to beginning blackjack you know that the house gains its edge by the fact that the player must act first. Since the basic strategy chart only deals with the first two cards, you will also need to learn what decisions to make after taking a hit.</p>
