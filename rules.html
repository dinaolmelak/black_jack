                    <p>Busting in blackjack is a perilous outcome that every player should be wary of. It occurs when the total value of your hand exceeds 21 points, resulting in an automatic loss of the round. While aiming to get as close to 21 as possible is essential, it's crucial not to push your luck too far. Hence busting can swiftly turn a winning position into a losing one, leaving you empty-handed. To avoid this unfortunate fate, players must exercise caution, employ sound strategies, and carefully consider their options when deciding whether to hit or stand. In the game of blackjack, knowing when to stop is just as crucial as knowing when to play, and mastering this balance is key to a successful and enjoyable experience at the table.</p>
